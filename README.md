# 🌙 Image Enhancement Using GAN (Night Photography Denoising)

A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Night Photography Denoising by combining BM3D, CycleGAN, Vision Transformers, and Perceptual Loss. This project enhances low-light images while preserving texture and detail, outperforming traditional and standalone deep learning models.

## 🧠 Core Technologies

- **BM3D** – Traditional denoising algorithm
- **CycleGAN** – For unpaired image-to-image translation
- **Vision Transformers** – For texture refinement and long-range dependencies
- **Perceptual Loss** – For visual realism using VGG networks
